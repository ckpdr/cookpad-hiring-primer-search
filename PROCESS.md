# Technical Exercise Process

Someone from our technical team will grant you access to a private Github repo at a time that's
been pre-arranged with you. The repo will contain the instructions with the problem's description and
(possibly) some code examples.

You should work on the exercise for up to 3 hours.

## Guidance

- **Prioritise demonstrating an overall solution**, rather than devoting too much time to fixing
  little problems at runtime. Bear in mind that to provide a comprehensive solution to the exercise
  might take longer than the allotted time. In our evaluation, we are not focused on the code
  running correctly. We are more interested to see an end to end solution/scaffold focusing in aspects
  like code design, flexibility, extensibility, maintainability, etc.
- **Treat the codebase as your own**. Do not feel constrained in parts of the repository you can edit.
  You are welcome to make any changes to the code (or tooling or anything else) that you see is a
  priority.
- **Note any proposed improvements in `IMPROVEMENTS.md`**. You might identify ways in which your solution,
  and/or the codebase in general, can be improved, but not have the time to implement those changes. There
  will be an empty `IMPROVEMENTS.md` file in the exercise repository in which you can highlight any such
  improvements.

## Process

Before the exercise:

- You should have access to this Primer Repo.
- You should have provided Cookpad with your Github username.
- You should have arranged a date and time for the exercise.

The start of the exercise:

- At the arranged time, your Github user will receive an invitation to a private repository
  containing the Exercise. Keep an eye on your e-mails and Github account. The invite will be sent
  at, or soon after, the arranged time.

During the exercise:

- **IMPORTANT:** Once you have access, you should **immediately fork** the repository. This way we
  can make sure that there won't be any technical issues later for pushing the solution. You should
  ensure your fork is a **private repository** (this is the default Github behaviour).
- You should work on the problem for up to 3 hours. An incremental Git commit history is
  encouraged but not required.

To submit the exercise:

- A pull request should be created from your fork to the original Cookpad repository. We will only
  consider commits that were created during the 3 hour window, so **don't forget to push your
  final commit** within the time window. If you prefer to create the pull request to the repo
  immediately, before beginning work on the solution, that is also fine.

## Follow up

1 hour call will be scheduled where the team will discuss the exercise with you, as well as other
Python-related topics, and give you an opportunity to ask questions about Cookpad.
