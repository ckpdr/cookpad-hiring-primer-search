# Cookpad - Search - Technical exercise primer

This is a primer to prepare you for the Search Technical Exercise. Please read through this repo
before the date of your exercise. This will minimise the amount of set-up time you need to do.

You can find instructions on setting up the exercise prerequisites [here](PREREQUISITES.md).

Guidelines to understand how the process works for the technical exercise
[here](PROCESS.md).

In case you are applying for a role more focused on search relevance, it's likely that you'll use Elasticsearch as part of this exercise. 
If you're not a regular user of Elasticsearch, it would be helpful to spend just a bit of time familiarizing yourself with the [Elasticsearch DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) for building queries.

Finally, to access the technical exercise itself, you'll need to have [2FA set up](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) 
on your GitHub account.

Once you are happy you have the pre-requisites set up, please email our team to confirm you are
ready, making sure to include the GitHub account name you'd like to use for the exercise.

Thanks, again, for your interest in Cookpad and we hope you enjoy the exercise.
